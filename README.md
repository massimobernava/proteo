# Proteo

Proteo framework is designed to develop **Serious Games** with **Deep Learning** support, it work as a general purpose glue, and wraps together several libraries::

- Lua for script
- SDL for graphics and audio
- OpenCV for computer vision
- Enet and ZMQ for networking
- Sqlite and Ejdb for database
- Tensorflow for machine learning
- Opus and x264 codecs 

The API is designed to be minimal and easy: one API for client and server.
The code is written in C to be cross-compatible: client support five operating systems (Windows, OSX, Linux, iOS, Android) and browser through Emscripten. 

Do you want to be a full stack developer? With Proteo you just need a single programming language and a minimalist API!
