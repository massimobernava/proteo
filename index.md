Proteo framework is designed to develop **Serious Games** with **Deep Learning** support, it work as a general purpose glue, and wraps together several commonly used libraries, including:

- Lua for script
- SDL for graphics and audio
- OpenCV for computer vision
- Enet and ZMQ for networking
- Sqlite and Ejdb for database
- Tensorflow for machine learning

The code is written in C to be massively cross-compatible. Client support five operating systems (Windows, OSX, Linux, iOS, Android). The API is designed to be minimal and easy to grasp.
