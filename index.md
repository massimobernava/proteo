# Proteo

Proteo framework is designed to develop serius games with the use of deep learning, it work as a general purpose glue, and wraps together several commonly used libraries, including:

-Lua for script
-SDL for graphics and audio
-OpenCV for computer vision
-Enet and ZMQ for 
-Sqlite and Ejdb for 
-Tensorflow for

The code is written in C to be massively cross-compatible. Right now we support five operating systems (Windows, OSX, Linux, iOS, Android). The API is designed to be minimal and easy to grasp.
